`fql-ts` is a Typescript lexer for [Segment's](https://segment.com) [Filter Query Language](https://github.com/segmentio/fql) (FQL).

The goal is to allow us to use FQL on the browser and generate React components on top of FQL. It could
also be used to give our FQL in-browser REPLs and integrate into existing tooling.
